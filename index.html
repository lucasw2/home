		<h2>Definition</h2>
		<p>Anarchism is an anti-authority political philosophy. It rejects political hierarchy and promotes self-governing which means 
		that it does not have a government. It derives from the Greek word "anarchos" which means “without authority". Anarchism is grounded 
		in moral claims about the importance of individual liberty. Anarchism has inspired establishing utopian communities, radical and 
		revolutionary political agendas. Anarchist thought primarily developed in the West and expanded around the world. Although there are many 
		definitions of anarchism, the most widely agreed definition is by Peter Kropotkin. According to Kropotkin, anarchism "is a name given to a
		principle or theory of life and conduct under which societyis conceived without government – harmony in such a society being obtained, 
		not by the submission to law, or by obedience to any authority,but by free agreements concluded between the various groups, territorial and 
		professional, freely constituted for the sake of production and consumption, as also for the satisfaction of the infinite variety of needs 
		and aspirations of a civilised being.”</p>
